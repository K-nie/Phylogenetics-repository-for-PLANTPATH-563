Project: Mannose-associated conserved genes in 267 yeast species (CDS/proteins → MSA)

this is the environment i created for this project: conda create -n phylo_env -c bioconda -c conda-forge iqtree mafft trimal fasttree
conda activate phylo_env
y

Goal:
I will analyze 267 yeast species from diverse taxa to identify genes that are conserved in mannose-utilizing species compared with species that do not metabolize mannose. The workflow uses protein/CDS sequences to run quality control, generate ortholog groups (or gene sets), perform multiple sequence alignment (MSA), and compare conservation patterns between the two phenotype groups.

Core idea:

QC protein/CDS/genome inputs

build comparable gene sets across species (e.g., orthogroups or curated genes)

run MSA per gene/orthogroup

quantify conservation and test enrichment in mannose-growers vs non-growers
I extracted 267 species from the y1000p_cds_files.tar.gz file into the processed directory and 
named it species_267.txt. after that, i realised i needed the genes from the specific corthgorups that were generated from the ML model. To do this, I filetered and extracted the 267 species from both cds and ortholog files. Currently, this is the way i am thinking about it
You can think of it like this:

Your ML output gives you a set of orthogroups (OGs) (say 200 OGs total across 6 models, with overlaps).

Each OG is its own “gene family bucket.”

Each species can contribute 0, 1, or many genes to a given OG (that’s why species 1 might “have” 5 OGs present, species 2 has 3, species 3 has 7, etc.).

Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is done per OG, not “per species”.

So the correct workflow is:

Workflow overview

1. Make one master list of OGs of interest (union of the 6 model outputs), i created a text file of the 9 OGs.

2. From the full 1,154-species orthogroups, subset to your 267 species

For each OG in your list, collect all gene IDs belonging to that OG from those 267 species

Extract the sequences for those gene IDs from your big FASTA pool

Write one FASTA per OG

Run MAFFT per OG (in a loop or as Condor array jobs)

That produces:

OG0001234.faa → align → OG0001234.aln.faa

OG0009876.faa → align → OG0009876.aln.faa

etc.
To do this, i updated the directory structure as i have it. 
this is what i did after parsing the data: Yes — run it. It’s the safer version of what you were going to do anyway, and it won’t change what you’re aligning; it just:

These are he parameters i used to run MAFFT 
skips OGs with <3 sequences (not useful for MSA): 

uses a more accurate MAFFT mode for small/medium OGs (≤200 seqs)

uses --auto for bigger OGs so you don’t accidentally pick a slow mode

Before you run it, do these two quick checks so you don’t hit a “command not found” or write logs into a missing folder:

mafft --version
mkdir -p data/processed/03_ml_orthogroups/logs


Then run your loop exactly as written.

After it finishes, verify:

ls -1 data/processed/03_ml_orthogroups/06_alignments | wc -l
tail -n 20 data/processed/03_ml_orthogroups/logs/mafft_run.log

A few key takeaways from what you pasted:

Your OGs are huge (e.g., 1756, 1692, 1569 sequences). That’s why MAFFT chose FFT-NS-2 (fast but rough) under --auto. That’s expected.

OG0007179 had 3 sequences, so it used L-INS-i (your small-N branch). Also expected.

The “ambiguous characters” messages are normal (often X, B, Z, J, * in proteins).
A few quick reads of what this implies:

OG0000007 / 8 / 9 / 20 are massive gene families (multi-copy + many species). That’s why you’re seeing multi-MB files (up to 13 MB).

OG0007179 is tiny (3 sequences), so 1.6 KB is expected.

The @ after permissions on a few files just means macOS has extended attributes on those files (often harmless; sometimes from downloads). Not an error.

I then used TrimAl to clip weak alignments i installed trimal witht the following command: conda install -c bioconda trimal
