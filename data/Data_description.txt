Project: Mannose-associated conserved genes in 267 yeast species (CDS/proteins → MSA)

Goal:
I will analyze 267 yeast species from diverse taxa to identify genes that are conserved in mannose-utilizing species compared with species that do not metabolize mannose. The workflow uses protein/CDS sequences to run quality control, generate ortholog groups (or gene sets), perform multiple sequence alignment (MSA), and compare conservation patterns between the two phenotype groups.

Core idea:

QC protein/CDS/genome inputs

build comparable gene sets across species (e.g., orthogroups or curated genes)

run MSA per gene/orthogroup

quantify conservation and test enrichment in mannose-growers vs non-growers
