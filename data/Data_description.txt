Project: Mannose-associated conserved genes in 267 yeast species (CDS/proteins → OG-based MSA)
Dataset description (what the data are)

This project uses a comparative genomics dataset of 267 yeast species selected from the Y1000+ (1,154-species) budding yeast resource. The core inputs are:
Coding sequences (CDS) and/or proteins for a larger Y1000+ collection (distributed as compressed archives such as y1000p_cds_files.tar.gz). A species subset list (species_267.txt) specifying the 267 species used in this semester’s analysis. Orthogroup assignments (OGs) from the full Y1000+ orthology dataset, where each OG represents a putative gene family.

A target OG list derived from prior machine-learning (ML) analyses (e.g., “top orthogroups” from several models). In the current run, I created a file containing 9 OGs (union of the ML outputs available at this stage). The dataset is not raw sequencing reads (no FASTQ). It is assembled gene sequences (CDS/proteins) + orthology mapping. This means the analysis begins at the level of gene families and alignments, not read QC (FastQC).

Biological question (what we’re trying to learn)
The goal is to identify genes (orthogroups) whose sequences are more conserved among mannose-utilizing yeasts compared with yeasts that do not metabolize mannose efficiently. “Conservation” here refers to patterns in multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), such as: increased amino acid identity or similarity, reduced gap-rich / poorly aligned regions after trimming, consistent conserved motifs/domains across mannose growers, potential enrichment of conserved features in one phenotype group.
Why orthogroups are the correct unit of analysis
The ML analysis produces a set of orthogroups (OGs) that are predictive of mannose phenotype. Each OG is a gene family bucket. A species may contribute zero genes to an OG (gene absent), one gene (single-copy), or multiple genes (paralogs / multi-copy families). Therefore, MSA is performed per OG, not per species. The analysis structure is:
OG → collect all member sequences across the 267 species → align → trim → downstream conservation metrics / phylogeny
Workflow overview (what was done)
1) Subset to 267 species
I extracted the 267 species from the Y1000+ CDS/protein archive and recorded them in:
species_267.txt. I then subset the full orthogroup mapping to retain only gene IDs belonging to these 267 species, ensuring downstream alignments reflect the same species panel.
2) Build per-OG FASTA files (from ML-selected OGs)
For each OG in the ML-derived target list: collect gene IDs belonging to that OG (restricted to the 267 species), extract their sequences from the large FASTA pool, write one FASTA per OG.
Output conceptually looks like: OG0000007.faa, OG0000008.faa, …, OG0007179.faa
This creates clean, reproducible “gene family datasets” for alignment.
3) Multiple Sequence Alignment with MAFFT (per OG)
What was run: align each OG FASTA to produce one alignment per OG. Outputs:OG0000007.aln.fasta,
OG0000008.aln.fasta, etc. MAFFT configuration (what it was + why). Because OG sizes vary massively (from 3 sequences to >1700 sequences), the workflow uses a size-aware strategy:
Skip OGs with < 3 sequences
Why: with 1–2 sequences there is no meaningful “multiple” alignment; these do not support conservation comparisons across species.

Small/medium OGs (≤ 200 sequences): use a more accurate mode
Typical choice: --localpair --maxiterate 1000 (L-INS-i–style behavior). Why: when sequence count is manageable, it’s worth paying the cost for improved accuracy—especially if we care about conserved motifs/domains. Large OGs (> 200 sequences): use --auto
Why: --auto lets MAFFT choose a feasible strategy. For very large families, MAFFT often selects FFT-NS-2, which is faster but rougher—this is expected and necessary for tractability. This approach balances: accuracy where possible (small OGs), scalability where necessary (huge OGs), while keeping the pipeline fully automated and reproducible.
4) Alignment trimming with TrimAl. After MAFFT, alignments often contain:poorly aligned columns, gap-rich tails, noisy regions from divergent paralogs. These can inflate downstream conservation metrics and destabilize phylogenetic inference. TrimAl configuration (what it was + why). TrimAl mode used: -automated1
Why: -automated1 is a standard, widely used “safe default” that automatically chooses trimming thresholds based on alignment characteristics (gap distribution, consistency). It reduces manual parameter tuning while still removing low-quality alignment columns that often drive false signals.Outputs intended:OG0000007.trim.aln.fasta, OG0000008.trim.aln.fasta, etc.
These trimmed alignments are the correct inputs for: per-gene trees (IQ-TREE), conservation scoring, phenotype group comparisons.
